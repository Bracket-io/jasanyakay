    timeline: "2025",
    category: "Fintech",
    status: "Independent product",

    overview:
      "Bracket was an independent product experiment focused on helping young people make better financial decisions. Rather than becoming another financial-content library, I explored how a product could turn fragmented information into clearer, more actionable decisions.",

    problem:
      "Young people have access to an enormous amount of financial information, but information availability does not necessarily translate into confident action. Advice is fragmented across sources such as YouTube, ChatGPT, social media, and financial websites, making it difficult to know what to trust or what to do next.",

    context:
      "I started with the hypothesis that the problem was not simply a lack of financial education. Young people could already find information. The bigger opportunity was helping them navigate that information and turn it into practical decisions.",

    approach: [
      "Interviewed 20+ students about their financial habits, weekly routines, and how they currently make financial decisions",
      "Reviewed existing sources and products students use for financial information, including YouTube and ChatGPT",
      "Explored potential product features and prioritized the smallest useful experience",
      "Started with wireframes before moving to Lovable to accelerate prototyping and product iteration",
      "Released the product publicly and used early user behavior to identify areas for improvement",
    ],

    productThinking: [
      "Start with the user's decision rather than the information they might consume",
      "Use discovery to understand existing behavior before designing features",
      "Prioritize a focused experience instead of trying to solve every financial problem",
      "Use rapid prototyping to test product assumptions before investing heavily in implementation",
      "Treat early adoption and retention as learning signals rather than assuming launch equals product-market fit",
    ],

    execution: [
      "Conducted qualitative discovery with 20+ students",
      "Mapped existing alternatives and information sources",
      "Created initial wireframes",
      "Transitioned to Lovable to accelerate the build-test-learn cycle",
      "Launched the product and acquired 100+ users during the early product period",
    ],

    outcome: [
      "100+ users joined the platform during the early product period",
      "The product generated real-world usage beyond the initial research participants",
      "Early churn was higher than desired, creating a clear signal that acquisition alone was not enough",
    ],

    learnings: [
      "Access to information is not the same as confidence in making a decision",
      "User interviews helped distinguish the underlying problem from the obvious feature opportunity",
      "Rapid building made it possible to test the product with real users much earlier",
      "100+ users demonstrated initial interest, but retention exposed weaknesses that acquisition numbers alone could hide",
      "The next product question became less about adding features and more about understanding why users did not continue",
